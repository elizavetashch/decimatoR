possible issues/ things that have to be updated, made better: 
- have to add the option argument in the process_to_dd_coordinates
- issue/adjustment: someone might want to call this function only to latitude or longitude, and it will break 
- issue/adjustment: there is to less flexibility when using minor functions. it would ve been much cooler, if you could apply those outside a dataframe.
- introduce other types of intervals.
